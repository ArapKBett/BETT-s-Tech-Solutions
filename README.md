Set Up the Project

`npx create-react-app betts-inc
cd betts-inc`

Install Dependencies

`npm install three @react-three/fiber @react-three/drei strapi`

Set up Strapi (or any other headless CMS) to manage your content. Follow the Strapi documentation to create a new project and define your content types (e.g., services, about, contact).

Create a service to fetch data from the CMS. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume you have an endpoint that returns the necessary data.

Update the React App using `App.js`

Ensure all components are integrated and working together.
